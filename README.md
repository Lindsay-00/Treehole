# Treehole
-Introduction-
Yale Tree Hole is a forum where users can post, reply, search for, edit, and/or delete their own posts. All posts and comments are anonymous and will be deleted after 24 hours of their posting, creating a safer space for users to speak their minds, as compared to identifiable social media platforms.


-How to Use-
1. Open page in local server:
    In VScode’s terminal, execute “cd FINAL_project” to be directed to the project directory. Then, execute “flask run” and click on the URL provided to open the website on a local server.

2.Register & Login:
    Read the welcome message before entering. Once you click the button below, if you are not previously registered, you will be directed to the register page. If you are not previously logged in, you will be directed to the login page. If you are previously logged in, clicking on the button will direct you to the index page.

3. Browse content:
    Either click on the button on the welcome page or the “Home” button on the navigation bar to be directed to the index page, where you can see all the existing posts and all their corresponding comments. The posts are organized by time of creation: the newest posts will show up at the top.

4. Comment:
    Next to the display of each post, you will see a text box and reply button. Use this to leave any comment you wish to add to the thread of that post. The added comment should immediately display in the comments section after clicking on the reply button. Note that you won’t be able to delete any comment you make, so be mindful of what you say in the comments section.

    To make your own post, click on “Say Something” on the navigation bar to be directed to the posting page. There, you can type in the title and body of your post to be posted.

7. Delete:
    To delete a post, simply click on the “Delete” button corresponding to the post. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion of a post to prevent accidental deletes. Remember that deleting a post will also delete all its comments.

    Using the search box on the top right corner of the page, you can type in a certain keyword you’re looking for, and click on the search button.
